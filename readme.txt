@tik Explode Tabs

Purpose
=======

Some of us marketing and usability focused folks know through experience and experimentation that for the general population, tabs don't work. People are much more likely to scroll than to click. http://forum.opencart.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=22111

It is not a coincidence that Amazon use mile-long pages instead of the neat organization of tabs.

Unfortunately, the default theme uses tabs for reviews, related products, etc., which are critical informations that assist in purchase-decisions. Hiding information is not a good idea. 

Hence, this very simple vQmod, which essentially explodes the tabs and shows a longer, scrollable page.

In the interest of cleanliness, tiny tweaks are made to page CSS as well.

Version 1.1 also reverses the sequence of reviews and related products, putting the related products above reviews, with the hope of cross-selling.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
